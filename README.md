# Hi, I'm Timo Anttila

I'm a full stack web developer who is passionate about making websites better and faster. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Svelte, PHP and SQL. Always want to surpass myself and my customers. When the customer feels they have received more than they originally ordered, I succeeded.

I love my job and always try to develop better and faster websites and follow the latest coding trends.
