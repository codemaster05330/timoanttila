## Location:

## Professional title:

## Professional life:

Designing and developing experiences that make people's lives simpler. Full-stack web developer who is passionate about making websites and web stores better, faster, and easier to update.

Since beginning my journey as an entrepreneur over seven years ago, I've done remote work for businesses, developed hundreds of customer projects, and created booking calendars and my own e-commerce platform. Also implemented various payment interfaces and REST APIs. Always ready for new challenges.

Technologies I enjoy working with include JavaScript, Nuxt, Vue, React, TypeScript, PHP, Nodejs and MariaDB. ProcessWire and WordPress CMS are frequently used. My main job is developing React webapps.

A focus on simplicity, speed, usability, easy updating, and delight. My goal is to surpass myself and my customers. When the customer feels they have received more than they originally ordered, I succeed.
