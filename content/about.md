## Professional life:

Full stack web developer who is passionate about making websites and web stores better, faster and easier to update.

Since beginning my journey as an entrepreneur over seven years ago, I've done remote work for businesses, developed hundreds of customer projects, and created booking calendars and my own ecommerce platform. Also implemented various payment interfaces and REST APIs. Always ready for new challenges.

Technologies I enjoy working with include JavaScript, Nuxt, Vue, React, TypeScript, PHP and MariaDB. Mostly using ProcessWire and WordPress CMS.

Designing and developing experiences that make people's lives simpler. A focus on simplicity, speed, usability, easy update and delight. My goal is to surpass myself and my customers. When the customer feels they have received more than they originally ordered, I succeed.
