You can also download the package from <a href=\"https://www.teamspeak.com/en/downloads/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the official website</a>.\n\nMove the packages to the server and unzip it.\n\n```Shell\ntar xvjf teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64-3.8.0.tar.bz2\n```\n\nNow we have a TeamSpeak 3 server folder which you want to move to a better place. The folder's name depends which package you chose. I assume you work in the same directory where you download it. You need sudo if you don't work as root or superuser already.\n\n```Shell\nsudo mv teamspeak3-server_linux-amd64 /usr/local/teamspeak3\n```\n\n## Run the TeamSpeak 3 server as service\n\nNext we want to make it run as service and startup after boot. First, we make symbolic link to `/etc/init.d`.\n\n```Shell\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/teamspeak3/ts3server_startscript.sh /etc/init.d/teamspeak3\n```\n\nThen we have to create a user who runs TeamSpeak as a service. We don't want that user able to log in so this is a local account only. New users need privilege to run the service so we must change the ownership of the folder to user teamspeak3.\n\n```Shell\nsudo adduser --disabled-login teamspeak3\nsudo chown -R teamspeak3 /usr/local/teamspeak3\nsudo update-rc.d teamspeak3 defaults\n```\n\n## Running the server first time\n\nNow we’re all done and it’s time to start the TeamSpeak 3 server for the first time.\n\n```Shell\nsudo service teamspeak3 start\n```\n\nNow there is very important information for you. You need a token to raise your level of admin group and there is also login information for Telnet connections. You can use the token only once, but write down the login information because those are the only way to restore your admin rights if you delete your TeamSpeak information from your client computer.\n\nYour server is probably protected with a firewall so you need to open the port for TeamSpeak 3 server. The default port for voice is 9987 (UDP) and for Telnet 10011 (TCP). If you use ufw the command will be:\n\n```Shell\nsudo ufw allow 9987/udp\n```\n\n## Gaining the power\n\nNow use your TeamSpeak 3 client to connect your server. When you log in the first time the server will ask for the token. Copy the code from the server window and hit enter. Now you're the Boss. You can do whatever you want and no one can stop you.\n\nFirst, you should go check out server and channel groups and make them as you like. After that, create your channels and let people in.\n\n## Restore admin rights\n\nUse the Telnet connection to your server where TeamSpeak is running.\n\n```Shell\ntelnet your_ip/host 10011\n```\n\nAfter successful login, write this to the input line.\n\n```Shell\nlogin serveradmin password\nclientsetserverquerylogin client_login_name=serveradmin\n```"],"names":["metadata","title","pub","published","modified","summary","layout"],"mappings":"ytKAS2BA,4LAAAA,yIARbA,GAAYC,MAAQ,mCAAmCC,KAAO,GAAG,OAAOC,UAAY,2BAA2BC,SAAW,2BAA2BC,QAAU,+EAA+EC,OAAS"}
