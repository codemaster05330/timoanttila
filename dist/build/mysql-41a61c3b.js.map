Getting the right packets depends on your system, but it's very easy if you're using Debian / Ubuntu based systems or CentOS. Use a complex password for the root account when the system asks you to type it. Do not use same password what you use for your server's root / superuser account.\n\n### Debian and Ubuntu\n\n```Shell\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n```\n\n### CentOS:\n\n```Shell\nsudo yum install mysql-server\n/etc/init.d/mysqld start\n```\n\nNow you should have the MySQL server up and running.\n\n### Starting server\n\nYou can start, restart and stop the server easily:\n\n```Shell\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart | stop | start\n```\n\n## How to access the MySQL server\n\nI prefer a graphical interface for creating and managing databases and users (ex. <a href=\"https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MySQL Workbench</a>, <a href=\"https://www.heidisql.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HeidiSQL</a>, <a href=\"https://www.phpmyadmin.net/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">phpMyAdmin</a>, but you can also connect to the MySQL server by typing the following command into terminal:\n\n```Shell\nmysql -u username -p\n```\n\nIf you're logging in the first time, then you probably don't have any other users than root and the password for that user is whatever you put when you installed the MySQL server.\n\nRemember, all MySQL commands end with a semicolon (;). The command will not execute without it.\n\nIt is common practise that MySQL commands are written in uppercase and everything else, like database and user names, are in lowercase to make them easier to distinguish. However, the MySQL command line is not case sensitive and you can write everything in lowercase if you like to.\n\n## How to create, access and delete a MySQL Database\n\nLet's make a database called test. Log in to the MySQL server as root and type:\n\n```SQL\nCREATE DATABASE test;\nCREATE DATABASE test CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;\n```\n\nIf you want to know what databases are available:\n\n```SQL\nSHOW DATABASES;\n```\n\nThe command above shows all the databases that are created in the MySQL server.\n\nAfter creating a database, you can start using it and store information in it. Open the database by typing:\n\n```SQL\nUSE test;\n```\n\nNow you're in the database and can create tables. Remember, table and database names are case sensitive.\n\n## How to create a table inside of the database\n\nLet's create a table called test. There has to be a <strong>PRIMARY KEY</strong> in every table and in this case the key is <strong>AUTO_INCREMENT</strong> meaning it automatically numbers each row. The key must be unique, because rows are identified by it.\n\nThere will also be a name and birthday. Name is using <strong>VARCHAR</strong> and bday is <strong>DATE</strong>. MySQL requires that dates be written as <strong>yyyy-mm-dd</strong>.\n\n```SQL\nCREATE TABLE test (\n    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    name VARCHAR(20),\n    bday DATE\n);\n```\n\nNow you can see what you just did by typing:\n\n```SQL\nSHOW TABLES;\n```\n\n## Structure\n\n```SQL\nDESCRIBE test;\n```\n\n## How to add information to a MySQL table\n\nUse this format to insert information into each row:\n\n```SQL\nINSERT INTO 'test' ('id','name','food','confirmed','signup_date')\nVALUES (NULL, \"Max\", '1977-07-17');\n```\n\nIf you want to see what table has been eating:\n\n```SQL\nSELECT * FROM test;\n```\n\nYou can also update existing data:\n\n```SQL\nUPDATE 'test' SET 'bday' = '1981-07-17' WHERE 'test'.'name' ='Max';\n```\n\n### How to delete a database\n\nWhen the database is no longer needed you can drop it.\n\n```SQL\nDROP DATABASE test;\n```\n\n## How to create a new MySQL user\n\n```SQL\nCREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\n```\n\nThere should be only one database per user. It is more secure.\n\n## MySQL user permission\n\nThe next command will give all the rights to the certain database but the user can not grant privileges to other users or take anything from them. The user can control the database, create tables and data, and drop everything. That is the most common way to give access to the database.\n\n```SQL\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO 'newuser'@'localhost';\n```\n\nIf you really want to, you can also give the user superuser rights with the grant option. That is not recommended when working with CMS or apps.\n\n```SQL\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mydb.* TO 'myuser'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;\n```\n\nYou can also give certain permissions to the database or the table if you don't want to give all the rights.\n\n```SQL\nGRANT [type of permission] ON [database name].[table name] TO 'username'@'localhost';\n```\n\nOr you can revoke some rights if the user don't need them:\n\n```SQL\nREVOKE [type of permission] ON [database name].[table name] FROM 'username'@'localhost';\n```\n\nAfter making a change, you should flush privileges.\n\n```SQL\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n```\n\n## Delete a MySQL user\n\n```SQL\nDROP USER 'demo'@'localhost';\n```\n\n## Optimize databases\n\n```SQL\nmysqlcheck -u username -p --optimize --all-databases\n```\n\nThanks for reading!"],"names":["metadata","title","pub","published","modified","summary","layout"],"mappings":"21XAS2BA,4LAAAA,yIARbA,GAAYC,MAAQ,wCAAwCC,KAAO,GAAG,OAAOC,UAAY,2BAA2BC,SAAW,2BAA2BC,QAAU,yJAAyJC,OAAS"}
