However, there was no easy way to embed pictures from Flickr to the website if you don't want to use slideshow and iframe. I searched and found a simple PHP script made by Mr. Haddad. He did a great job but it gave only large images as text so I had to tweak it a little bit.\n\nNowadays, it's all about loading time and speed so I wanted to use small thumbnails. All images used _b.jpg and smaller size images had their own ending so getting the right size was very easy; search _b and replace it with whatever you want. You can use the Fancybox effect to make it look nicer.\n\n```PHP\n<?php\n/* Author: Samuel Haddad (2010), edited by Timo Anttila (2015)\n * SimpleXML Flickr Feed Parser\n */\n\n// Feed URL in RSS Format\n$url =\"https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=136453500@N06&amp;lang=en-us&amp;format=rss_200\";\n\n//Use simple XML to parse the feed\n$xml = simplexml_load_file($url);\n$items = $xml->xpath('/rss/channel/item');\necho \"<div class='gallery'>\"; // Wrapper\n\nforeach($items as $item){\n    $nsmedia = $item->children('http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/');\n    $img = $nsmedia->content->attributes(); // Image URL (b)\n    $thumb = strtr($img, array ('_b.jpg' => '_t.jpg')); // Thumb\n    echo \"<a href='$img'><img src='$thumb' alt=''></a>\"; // Combine them all\n}\necho \"</div>\";\n?>\n```\n\n## Flickr Thumb Sizes\n\n- s: 75 x 75\n- q: 150 x 150\n- t: 100 x 75\n- m: 240 x 180\n- n: 320 x 320\n- z: 640 x 640\n- c: 800 x 600\n- b: 1024 x 768\n- o: 2400 x 1800\n\n## CSS\n\nEverything is working just fine but for better overview little bit of CSS is needed.\n\n```PHP\n.gallery a {\n    display: inline-block;\n    vertical-align: top;\n    padding: 5px;\n    border: 1px solid #ccc;\n    margin: 0 5px 5px 0;\n}\n\n.gallery a:nth-child(4n+0){\n    margin-right: 0;\n}\n```\n\nI like to use inline-block over float because inline-block does not need to be clear before .gallery's closing tag. Works better most of the time. I also like to make small padding with a border around images because it makes images look better. I don't know, maybe it's just me.\n\nFor the best performance you should use. gallery a: nth-child(4n+0) where the number 4 should be the last image from the first row. So if you have three pictures in a row, then the number should be three (3). The first number represents a cycle size, and is a counter (starts at 0), and last zero (0) is an offset value.\n\n### Source\n\n- <a href=\"http://samuelhaddad.com/2010/10/21/simple-xml-parse-flickr-feed/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Samuel Haddad: Simple XML Parse Flickr Feed\">samuelhaddad.com</a>\n- <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getSizes.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr</a>"],"names":["metadata","title","pub","published","modified","summary","layout"],"mappings":"qsIAS2BA,4LAAAA,yIARbA,GAAYC,MAAQ,0CAA0CC,KAAO,GAAG,OAAOC,UAAY,2BAA2BC,SAAW,2BAA2BC,QAAU,kGAAkGC,OAAS"}
