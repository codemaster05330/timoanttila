I've been using Ubuntu and Debian for a long time, but have never before come against this kind of problem. I looked for the problem for a long time and deleted all possible unnecessary files from the disk, but the hard drive quickly refilled.\n\nWhile looking for a solution to the problem, I found an software called *ncdu* (NCurses Disk Usage). Ncdu is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface. It is designed to find space hogs on a remote server where you don't have an entire graphical setup available. Like a gift from heaven.\n\n```Shell\nsudo apt install ncdu\n```\n\nNcdu is an awesome software for finding problems and it helped me find a 5.5 GB PHP sessions directory.\n\nThe server has been running for over three years and I have never cleaned old PHP session files. These files should be deleted with the correct setting in the *php.ini* file (*session.gc_maxlifetime*), but apparently it is not configured by default. There were 1 216 910 unnecessary files. Normal rm -f could not destroy the files, so had to look for an alternative solution and a simple perl script solved the problem.\n\n```Bash\ncd /var/lib/php/sessions\nperl -e 'for(<*>){((stat)[9]<(unlink))}'\n```\n\nUbuntu/Debian have a script (*/etc/cron.d/php*) to do the cleanup automatically, but I guess it's broken. Because I like simple answers to problems, I added the following line to root *crontab*:\n\n```Crontab\ncrontab -e\n16 3 * * 1 rm -f /var/lib/php/sessions/*\n```\n\nThe command destroys all files in the directory on Monday at 3:16. Problem solved."],"names":["metadata","title","pub","published","modified","summary","layout"],"mappings":"4pFAS2BA,4LAAAA,yIARbA,GAAYC,MAAQ,kDAAkDC,KAAO,GAAG,OAAOC,UAAY,2BAA2BC,SAAW,2BAA2BC,QAAU,yHAAyHC,OAAS"}
