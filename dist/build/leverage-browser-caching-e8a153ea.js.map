And those websites also make a lot of requests to the web server. First visit is always harder and takes longer time to load, but after that, those websites could use browser caching instead of loading all that data again from the website's server.\n\nBrowser caching stores some of the loaded files locally in the user's browser. Files like all the HTML, CSS, JavaScripts and images. When a user visits the same website again, refreshes a page or moves to a new page in the same website, they already have some of the data locally and requested page load faster. Less data to load and less requests to the server.\n\nEasiest way to enable browser caching on a website running on Apache2 is to modify a file called .htaccess. The \"code\" below tells browsers how long it should \"remember\" files loaded from the web site.\n\n```htaccess\n<IfModule mod_expires.c>\nExpiresActive On\nExpiresByType image/jpg \"access 1 month\"\nExpiresByType image/jpeg \"access 1 month\"\nExpiresByType image/png \"access 1 year\"\nExpiresByType text/css \"access 1 month\"\nExpiresByType text/html \"access 1 month\"\nExpiresByType application/pdf \"access 1 year\"\nExpiresByType application/javascript \"access 1 year\"\nExpiresByType application/x-javascript \"access 1 year\"\nExpiresByType image/x-icon \"access 1 year\"\nExpiresDefault \"access 2 days\"\n</IfModule>\n```\n\n## Read more\n\n- <a href=\"https://varvy.com/pagespeed/leverage-browser-caching.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Varvy</a>\n- <a href=\"https://gtmetrix.com/leverage-browser-caching.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GTmetrix</a>\n- <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>"],"names":["metadata","title","pub","published","modified","summary","layout"],"mappings":"uuFAS2BA,4LAAAA,yIARbA,GAAYC,MAAQ,iEAAiEC,KAAO,GAAG,OAAOC,UAAY,2BAA2BC,SAAW,2BAA2BC,QAAU,yHAAyHC,OAAS"}
